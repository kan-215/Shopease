I am planning on incorporating the following features into my application in the future:

- Multi-language Support: Cater to a global audience by supporting multiple languages.
- Rewards System: Introduce a loyalty program for frequent shoppers.
- Reviews System: Users can leave reviews on different products after they have received the produts they ordered.
-------------------------------------------------------
Some challenges i faced during the implemetation of this application include:
(i) Implemetation of a fully functional cart. I initially had the issue with the cart whereby clicking on add t cart button was not adding the items to the cart. Also the cart was not clearing after checking out the product. I managed to resolve this issue and noe the cart is fully functional as seen in the live demo.
(ii) Backend Database integration: initially i had implemented my database using SQL database, but faced issues with connecting my application to the database. To resolve this i shifted to  using Mongo DB.
